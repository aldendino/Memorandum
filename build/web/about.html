                <p>Adrienne McLaren Devenyi is the director and the co-writer of Memorandum.
                    One of her fondest memories is when the song “Steal My Sunshine” was the song of the summer.
                    She was 6 years old and remembers cruising around downtown
                    with her mom and not having a care in the world.<br><br>

                    Memorandum is a slice-of-life narrative about the power of memory and what can become
                    of a person when they can no longer make memories. Adrienne is so excited and motivated
                    to be making a film built for the senses, and to make something as serious
                    as Alzheimer’s come through in an honest yet beautifully composed way.</p>

                <p>Brian Hongku Han is the digital media producer and post-production/editor for Memorandum film.
                    He values the meaning of memories and how every piece of memories can impacts one's
                    or community's pathway, and he joined the production to express his passion
                    by putting creative inputs into production of Memorandum.
                    Brian's most fondest memory would be the first day when he moved to Canada.
                    The temperature, scent, snow, people, and even the background music at the airport...
                    are the most memorable event that will remain forever in him as the first impression of Canada.</p>

                    Her passion is creating and producing stories that explore human interactions
                    and evoke drama and a sense of nostalgia. These elements are what drew her to work on this film.
                    One of Isabelle’s fondest memories was when she travelled to LA for the first time.
                    It was an experience that made her feel more independent, helped her discover her love
                    for film and television as well as encouraging her to continue travelling abroad.</p>

                    helped mould her into the person she is today. Her fondest memory is when she had
                    the chance to interview Tim Burton and he told her
                    “I see a lot of knowledge, passion and depth in you.
                    You can be anything you want, a director or producer or even a camera woman
